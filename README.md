# Tkinter-Flashcards
Flashcard project to learn French using Python(Tkinter and pandas).
French words will be displayed for 5 seconds before revealing the English word. 
The French and English words will be read aloud.
French words from the french_words.csv will be used. A words_to_learn.csv file will be created for the user to keep updates on his/her progress.
A checkmark and cross button will be clicked either if the user knows or doesn't know the French word. 
If the user clicks the check button, indicating the user knows the word, the current word will be removed from the words_to_learn.csv file.
If the user clicks the cross button, indicating the user doesn't know word and would like to be tested on it later, the current word will not be removed from the words_to_learn.csv file.
